/**
 * Things related to quantum computing. Contains interfaces
 * that describe basic ideas of quantum computing and provides
 * implementations that simulate a quantum computer.<br><br>
 * 
 * If (someday) we'll be able to use Java with actual quantum computers,
 * only the core interfaces would need to be adapted to work with existing code.
